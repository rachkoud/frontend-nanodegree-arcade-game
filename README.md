Buggy Frogger
=============

This project is part of the [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001), I received visual assets and a game loop engine, using these tools I added added a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic game Frogger. I had the freedom to customize the game as I want, in addition to recreate the Frogger game, I added some rewards and a score system.

# Quickstart

### Install

Nothing to do here, no gulp tasks, nothing to setup.. just open index.html in your browser!

### Why this Project?

Games have a lot of objects and those objects do a lot of different things; but sometimes they do some very similar things as well. This creates a great opportunity to practice object-oriented programming in Javascript, an important programming paradigm that influences the application architecture and provides performance optimization.
